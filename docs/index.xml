      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>Migrate from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Overview In the literature, there are many investigations addressing the identification and quantification of biological hazards in foods surveyed at different stages in the farm-to-fork chain. Being able to access to and gather this information has become increasingly relevant in the development of pathogens’ risk assessment models, risk management tools and meta-analysis by both food researchers and food safety authorities. Nevertheless, this information is largely dispersed, disharmonised and not always accessible.</description>

      <description>Support So far, the Pathogens-in-Foods database contains microbiological survey results extracted from over 1000 peer-reviewed articles published since 1998. The team is continuously searching for scientific articles, and extracting the new information to keep the database updated and growing. Pathogens-in-Foods is expected to evolve soon into a platform of dashboards for data visualisation, description and summarisation.
 DONATING DATA The Pathogens-In-Foods team accepts quality data on incidence and/or concentration of pathogens in foods, obtained from random surveys conducted at any stage of the food chain: primary production, processing, retail and restauration.</description>
