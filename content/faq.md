## Q: What foodborne pathogens can be searched for?

Pathogens-In-Foods contains data for:
* **Bacteria**: _Salmonella_ spp., _Campylobacter_ spp., shigatoxin producing _Escherichia coli_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Yersinia enterocolitica_, _Bacillus cereus_, _Clostridium perfringens_, _Staphylococcus_ aureus.
* **Viruses**: norovirus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus.
* **Parasites**: _Cryptosporidium_ spp., _Toxoplasma gondii_ and _Giardia duodenalis_.

## Q: What types of food can be searched for?

All types of foods are supported. The broad categories are: meat and meat products, eggs and egg products, milk and dairy products, grains and cereal products, seafood, fruits, vegetables, legumes, beverages, sugars and multi-ingredient/composite foods.<br>  
In the search, these categories can be narrowed down by food subcategories, and further filtered by packaging status (packed, unpacked), stage in the food chain where sampling took place (farm, mid processing, end of processing, retail, restauration), temperature class at sampling (ambient, chilled, frozen), ready-to-eat status (yes, no) and food origin (country).

## Q: What is the difference between “Prevalence”, “Count” and “Both” when choosing Essay Type?

 **“Prevalence”** must be chosen in the field “Select Essay” if the objective is to retrieve data of the type detected/non detected (i.e., binary data).<br>   
In the case of bacterial agents, if you wish to retrieve microbiological results from __enrichment analysis__, the “Prevalence” option must be __always__ selected. Example: “Prevalence” should be chosen if you wish to access to enrichment analysis results for Salmonella spp. or Yersinia enterocolitica.

**“Counts”** must be selected if the objective is to retrieve concentration data (i.e., continuous data). However, in the particular case of bacterial agents, if you wish to retrieve microbiological results from __direct plating__ (without enrichment), the “Counts” option must be __always__ selected.<br>   
Example: “Counts” should be chosen if you wish to access to direct plating results for B. cereus, S. aureus or C. perfringens.

In the case of bacterial agents, **“Both”** must be selected if the objective is to retrieve results from investigations that have conducted __both enrichment and plating essays__ on the same set of samples.<br>   
Example: “Both” should be chosen if you wish to find enrichment and plating results for L. monocytogenes analysis conducted in parallel.

## Q: How should searches be performed?

The basic search is performed by selecting agent, type of essay and food category. Other filters can be applied to narrow down the results for obtaining more specific information.

## Q: Can I retrieve the data sources?

The **Basic** User does not have access to the bibliographic references of the primary studies.<br>   
The **Advanced User** can have this information providing certain conditions are met.<br>
