The Pathogens-in-Foods database has been re-designed and is ready to receive data.

Users can produce dynamic charts and summary statistics of incidence of bacteria in any food category, on a web application that is highly intuitive and easy to use. 

Pathogens-in-Foods has solid scientific and computational basis for growth, and is up to serve the scientific community and food authorities.
