So far, the Pathogens-in-Foods database contains microbiological survey results extracted from over 1000 peer-reviewed articles published since 1998. The team is continuously searching for scientific articles, and extracting the new information to keep the database updated and growing. Pathogens-in-Foods is expected to evolve soon into a platform of dashboards for data visualisation, description and summarisation.

### DONATING DATA

The Pathogens-In-Foods team accepts quality data on incidence and/or concentration of pathogens in foods, obtained from random surveys conducted at any stage of the food chain: primary production, processing, retail and restauration.  Pathogens-in-Foods does not contain data from foodborne disease investigations.

Presently, Pathogens-in-Foods supports data for _Salmonella_ spp., _Campylobacter_ spp., shigatoxin producing _Escherichia coli_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Yersinia enterocolitica_, _Bacillus cereus_, _Clostridium perfringens_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, norovirus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, _Cryptosporidium_ spp., _Toxoplasma gondii_ and _Giardia duodenalis_.

Microbiological surveysâ€™ data can be donated in two ways:
1. Completing an Excel spreadsheet template; or
2. Emailing data, report or published study directly to our team.
